		<p><b>History of Independence Day</b><br>
		
   	<ul type="square">

		<li>The story of India’s liberation is very long, with various freedom fighters fighting for their courage and tolerance. Meanwhile, European traders were increasingly seeking to settle in India and establish themselves on the Indian subcontinent. At the same time, in the Battle of Plessy in 1757 and the Battle of Buxar in 1764, India faced foreign forces, but India could not prove its strength and was defeated in these wars. Thereafter, the East India Company began to spread its influence in India and by the end of the 18th century, the British had established their monarchy in many parts of India.At the same time, the company harassed Indian society by enacting a number of stricter laws in India, as well as many oppressive policies that applied to the people. Because the Indians opposed the foreign emperor and created hatred for them. At the same time, it was because of these British oppressive policies that the 1857 uprising began from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh on May 10, 1857.</p></li>

		<li><p>At the same time, the war of 1857 is considered India’s first liberation war.Major rebels such as Mangal Pandey, Tatya Tope, Rani Laxmi Bai, Nana Saheb, Begum Hazrat Mahal, Rani Avanti Bai and Babu Kunwar have played their key role in this war. At the same time, our country could not stand on its own two feet in this war, but this transformation had a profound effect on all Indians and aroused a desire for freedom within the Indians.In line with this, after the war of 1857, the British rulers recognized the power of the Indians and after this, the cruel and  oppressive policies of the British East India Company began to weaken.After the Revolt of 1857, the Indian state was taken over by the British East India Company in 1858 and handed over to the British Crown which is the British Monarchy.</p></li>

		<li><p>At the end of the war of 1857, the liberation struggle spread to India and after that, the British felt that they could not rule India for long. At the same time, it rebelled after the civil war from 1885 to 1905, led by many major Indian revolutionaries, including India’s great freedom fighters Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Madan Mohan Malviya and Dadabhai Naoroji. All the reforms that led to this war were ideological and political, which fought for freedom peacefully.</p></li>

		<li><p>By the 19th century, however,the atrocities perpetrated by the British on the Indian subcontinent had intensified. Because at the end of the 19th century Lala Lajpat Rai, Bipin Chandra Pal took many steps against the British and provoked the anger in the minds of the Indians against the British. Everyone united in seeking independence in India.At the same time, as a result of the efforts of these freedom fighters,the British became afraid of the Indians.</p></li>

		<li><p>In the 19th century, several movements including the <mark>Non-Cooperation Movement, Civil Disobedience Movement and the Quit India Movement, Mahatma Gandhi’s Nonviolent Movement</mark> shook the foundations of the British and Indian empires. The road to freedom was easy, and he left no choice but to leave India and the British. Meanwhile, in 1885, the Indian National Congress Party was formed. In 1929, the Indian National Congress demanded complete independence.After that, freedom fighters, politicians and the Indian people united and strengthened their British rebellion against independence. As a result, the British Parliament ordered Lord Mount batten to rule in India until 30 June 1948, weakening the British Empire in India, but only then did the British see the flames and their level of intolerance within India. Lord Mountbatten decided to leave India in August 1947 before waiting for the deadline. The British, who had persecuted the Indians for so many years, sacrificed their lives in the face of the courage, courage and unity of the Indians. So on August 15, 1947, India became an independent nation.</p><li>
